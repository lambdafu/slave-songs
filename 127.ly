	Bright an -- gels on the wa -- ter,
	Hove -- ring by the light;
	Poor sin -- ner stand in the dark -- ness,
	And can -- not see the light.

	I want Aunt -- y Ma -- ryÂ¹ for to go with me,
	I want Aunt -- y Ma -- ry for to go with me,
	I want Aunt -- y Ma -- ry for to go with me,
	To join the so -- cial band.
